# Average Review Ratings

**Company:** Amazon SQL Interview Question

## Problem

Given the reviews table, write a query to retrieve the average star rating for each product, grouped by month. The output should display the month as a numerical value, product ID, and average star rating rounded to two decimal places. Sort the output first by month and then by product ID.

**reviews table:**

| Column Name  | Type              |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| review_id      | integer            |
| user_id        | integer            |
| submit_date    | datetime           |
| product_id     | integer            |
| stars          | integer (1-5)      |

### Example Input

reviews table:

| review_id | user_id | submit_date            | product_id | stars |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------ | ---------- | ----- |
| 6171      | 123     | 06/08/2022 00:00:00      | 50001      | 4     |
