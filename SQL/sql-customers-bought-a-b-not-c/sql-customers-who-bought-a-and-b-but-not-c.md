# Customers Who Bought A and B but Not C

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem

You are given two tables: `customers` and `orders`.

**customers table:**

| Column Name   | Type    |
| ------------- | ------- |
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |

`customer_id` is the primary key for this table. Each row contains a customer's ID and name.

**orders table:**

| Column Name  | Type    |
| ------------ | ------- |
| order_id     | int     |
| customer_id  | int     |
| product_name | varchar |

`order_id` is the primary key for this table. `customer_id` references the `customers` table. Each row represents an order placed by a customer for a specific product.

Write a query to find customers who purchased both products 'A' and 'B' but have never purchased product 'C'. These are potential customers to target for product C recommendations.

Return the `customer_id` and `customer_name` of these customers, ordered by `customer_name`.

### Example 1

**Input:**

customers table:

| customer_id | customer_name |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| 1           | Alice          |
| 2           | Bob            |
| 3           | Carol          |
| 4           | Dave           |

orders table:

| order_id | customer_id | product_name |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 101      | 1           | A            |
| 102      | 1           | B            |
| 103      | 1           | D            |
| 104      | 1           | C            |
| 105      | 2           | A            |
| 106      | 3           | A            |
| 107      | 3           | B            |
| 108      | 3           | D            |
| 109      | 4           | C            |

**Output:**

| customer_id | customer_name |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| 3           | Carol          |

**Explanation:**

- Alice (ID 1): Bought A and B, but also bought C → excluded
- Bob (ID 2): Only bought A (missing B) → excluded
- Carol (ID 3): Bought A and B, never bought C → included
- Dave (ID 4): Only bought C (missing A and B) → excluded

### Constraints

- Each customer has a unique ID.
- A customer can purchase the same product multiple times.
